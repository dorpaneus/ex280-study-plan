# EX280 - Red Hat Certified System Administrator in OpenShift (~30-day study plan)

> **Target version: OpenShift Container Platform 4.18 (latest, released Dec 2025).**
> This repo is a merged & sorted curriculum derived from:
> - The [official Red Hat EX280 objectives page](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/red-hat-certified-openshift-administrator-exam)
> - The OCP 4.18 product documentation at <https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18>.

The repo is organized **by official exam objective** - one Markdown file per objective. Study the file, do the labs in your own cluster, take the weekly mock exam.

## ⚠️ What changed vs. 4.14

Keep these 4.18 differences in mind:

| Topic | 4.14 behavior | 4.18 behavior |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| `oc new-app` default workload | Could create `DeploymentConfig` from S2I | Creates a **`Deployment`** by default; `DeploymentConfig` is **deprecated** |
| Default OpenShift SDN | OpenShift SDN was still supported | **OVN-Kubernetes** is the **only** supported CNI (SDN removed in 4.17) |
| Pod Security | PSA admission active but warning-mostly | **Pod Security Admission (PSA)** enforces baseline & restricted profiles by default; pair PSA labels with SCC choices |
| Cluster updates | Console + CLI | Console + CLI + **EUS-to-EUS** updates and per-NodePool MCP pausing more prominent |
| Helm | Helm 3 (Cluster-scoped Helm Charts repo available) | Helm 3, native ProjectHelmChartRepository CRD |
| Image registry | image-registry operator | Same, but uses CSI snapshots for backup by default in many installs |

Always default to `Deployment` over `DeploymentConfig` on the exam unless a question explicitly asks for the latter.

## 🎯 The 9 official EX280 objectives (current, OCP 4.18)

| # | Objective | File |
|---|-----------|------|
| 1 | Manage OpenShift Container Platform | [`01-manage-ocp.md`](./01-manage-ocp.md) |
| 2 | Work with resource manifests | [`02-resource-manifests.md`](./02-resource-manifests.md) |
| 3 | Deploy applications | [`03-deploy-applications.md`](./03-deploy-applications.md) |
| 4 | Manage authentication and authorization | [`04-auth-and-authorization.md`](./04-auth-and-authorization.md) |
| 5 | Configure network security | [`05-network-security.md`](./05-network-security.md) |
| 6 | Expose non-HTTP/SNI applications | [`06-expose-non-http-sni.md`](./06-expose-non-http-sni.md) |
| 7 | Enable developer self-service | [`07-developer-self-service.md`](./07-developer-self-service.md) |
| 8 | Manage OpenShift operators | [`08-openshift-operators.md`](./08-openshift-operators.md) |
| 9 | Configure application security | [`09-application-security.md`](./09-application-security.md) |
| ★ | **Supplement: Storage (PV/PVC/SC)** - dropped from formal 4.18 objectives but still surfaces in stateful-app tasks | [`10-storage-supplement.md`](./10-storage-supplement.md) |

> Red Hat rule: **all configurations must persist after reboot without intervention.** Use `oc`/YAML - never edit files on nodes by hand.

> Note on storage: Red Hat removed "Provision persistent storage volumes and use storage classes" as a standalone objective when moving from EX280 v4.14 → v4.18. It now lives implicitly inside "Deploy applications" (stateful workloads) and "Work with resource manifests" (PVC YAML). The supplement chapter (`10-storage-supplement.md`) covers it so you can complete the mock-exam tasks that use PVCs (Postgres, Mongo, etc.).

## ✅ How to use this repo

1. **Stand up your lab first.** Don't postpone this — see `lab-setup.md`. CRC 2.x runs OCP 4.18 on a laptop with 16 GB RAM.
2. **Read one objective file at a time.** Each ends with a "Drills" block — actually do them.
3. **Type every command yourself.** Muscle memory beats reading. Especially imperative `oc` commands with `--dry-run=client -o yaml`.
4. **At the exam you only get the official OpenShift docs at <https://docs.redhat.com>.** Practice navigating it now — `docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18`.
5. **Take every mock exam under exam conditions:** timer running, docs tab only, no Google, no AI.
6. **After each mock, journal what you missed** and add a row to the bottom of the relevant objective file in a "Gaps" section.

## 🎓 Passing score & exam logistics

- **Duration:** 3 hours, single section
- **Passing score:** 210 / 300 (70%)
- **Format:** Performance-based on a live OCP 4.18 cluster
- **Reference allowed:** Official OCP 4.18 documentation only — no internet, no notes
- **Persistence rule:** Everything must survive a node reboot

Good luck — see you on the other side of the cert. 🏅

— Maintainer notes: All `oc` examples and YAMLs target **OCP 4.18 / oc client 4.18+**. If you spot drift in a future minor release, file an issue.
